            <div class="textK"> Keanu Reeves returns to the screen in his best form and continues to amaze the audience with his exciting game. Let's start with a brief overview of the fourth part of the story about a mercenary whose weakness are puppies.</div>
            <div class="textK">The film begins where the third part ends, with John leaving the oasis without the right to return. But he decides to return and meets a new generation of murderers who know his name and thirst for his blood. Hmm, it seems that we have already seen this somewhere?</div>
            <div class="textK">But the film's directors did not rest on their laurels, adding new elements to the plot and improving the visual style. It is worth paying tribute, the fights do not leave us indifferent, maybe that's why we are still looking forward to the continuation of this story. In addition, the actions of the characters are interwoven with many hidden meanings, which makes this film exciting and suspenseful until the very end.</div>
            <div class="textK">It was not without John's family, which he kind of "forever" refused, and not without old friends, about whom we have known for a long time, but about some we are just learning, and of course, as in every movie, it was not without a fuzzy. True, this time the four-legged friend is not as kind and cute as the previous ones, but it's better for you to see him yourself.</div>
            <div class="textKend">In general, if you are a connoisseur of high-quality action movies and want to feel the adrenaline to your fingertips, then "John Wick 4" is a movie that you definitely need to watch. You will not remain indifferent to the style, drama and ruthless thirst for revenge of John Wick.</div>
